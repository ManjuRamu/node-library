Basic network like LAN
- Network card used to connect computers using switch like LAN network and ethernet cable.
- Network card has MAC address which has 48 bits represented in hex look like a8:71:17:b1:f4:8c which is unique. 
- Send data packets to a computer with has piece of info.  
  contains : source, destination MAC address and data. 
- Where switch get configured and find computer using MAC address and send the data packets and receiver receive data pockets using network card.

Routes on the top of switch so we connect multiple networks with can established connection between computers in diff network
 - Router has unique IP.
 - And Router assign IP to all computer connected to it.

 - So all computer can talk with each other using IP address.
 - Where we connect all computer using public IPs which is called internet. It can be anything
   Ex: Cellular network, wifi, LAN etc.
 - We need to mention port which will do some jobs. 

So all connection between computer are made by physical connection using cable 
ISP is are provide a way to connect our computer/mobile to internet i.e physical connection/network
